# IDEXCEL Microservices Learning Project

## Overview

This project was assigned to me  under the supervision of my training manager. The objective is to learn, design, and implement a set of microservices using modern full-stack development practices based on Spring Boot and Java.

This training-based implementation helps simulate a real-world enterprise microservices architecture, and my task involves building and integrating individual services, ensuring data flow, configuration, and deployment readiness.

## üîç Project Goals

- Understand microservices architecture
- Design RESTful APIs using Spring Boot
- Implement inter-service communication
- Connect microservices with MongoDB databases
- Perform local testing and integration using Docker and Testcontainers
- Deploy services locally or on the cloud (optional scope)

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª My Role and Responsibilities

As a Full-Stack Java Developer trainee, I was responsible for:

- Cloning and setting up the microservice project environment in IntelliJ IDEA
- Writing and updating Spring Boot controllers, services, and repositories
- Integrating MongoDB with each microservice
- Creating RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- Running and debugging services using IntelliJ and Postman
- Writing unit and integration tests (including with Testcontainers)
- Ensuring all services work independently and in coordination
- Managing Git version control using GitHub
